# RMSC4002Tutorial

First, you may want to create a working directory like ```RMSC4002/``` to store the course materials, i.e. datasets and notebooks.

Then, please download the following:

1. anaconda @ ```https://www.anaconda.com/download```
2. Pycharm CE @ ```https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/```

After that, click "launch" in the Notebook section inside Anaconda-Navigator.

Go to your working directory, e.g. ```RMSC4002/```, click "new" -> "file" -> "Notebook".

Select the default Kernel (usually Python conda env:base) for your Jupyter Notebook.

In the first cell, run ```!conda install git -y``` to download Git.
